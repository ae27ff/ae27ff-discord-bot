# ae27ff-discord-bot
A python discord bot for ae27ff rankings in channel pins, inspired by [LsFonseca1/Ae27ff-Rankings](https://github.com/LsFonseca1/Ae27ff-Rankings)

## work in progress
This bot is a work in progress and has some really sloppy code, and does not validate input or check for admin permissions at this time - use at your own risk.

## multichannel support
There is support for multiple pins in different channels or different servers inbuilt into the DiscordPins class.


## commands
* `!aeadduser yourae27ffnamehere` - add your ae27ff username to the ranking
* `!aecreate` - create a ranking message for pinning in the channel
* `!aedelete` - deletes the ranking message associated with the channel
* `!update` - not implemented yet
